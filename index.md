# Woven Community Rules

**Disclaimer:** Actions you perform in WovenMC community spaces are logged for moderation purposes, such as name changes, content deletions, and edits. This is to ensure the health of our community from bad actors.  
You must be 13 or older to participate in WovenMC community spaces. If you are found to be under 13, you will be banned until you are 13.

## Rule 1  
> Discriminatory, harassing, bullying, "trolling", or otherwise offensive or distasteful content, regardless if it were directed towards another community member or not, is prohibited. We have a **zero tolerance policy** on hate speech and harassment. Posting content which can reasonably considered intentionally attacking or offensive will result in disciplinary action.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include, but is not limited to:
- Using slurs, including but not limited to words like "trap" and "retard."
- Using language that uses identities, disabilities, illnesses, or other uncontrollable factors as the butt of a joke. This includes but is not limited to calling someone or something "triggered," "autistic," and "cancer."
- Using language that is sexual or refers to something sexual. This includes but is not limited to language such as "loli/shota," "thot," and "fetish."
- Posting images or content that is intended to start an argument or controversy.
- Anything the moderation feels is unacceptable behavior for our community.

## Rule 2
> All content that violates the terms of service of the platform being used for a Woven community space is strictly prohibited. For Discord, see [Discord Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Discord Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines). For GitHub, see [GitHub Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service). For Matrix, see [Terms and Conditions](https://www.matrix.org/legal/terms-and-conditions) and [Matrix Code of Conduct](https://www.matrix.org/legal/code-of-conduct).

## Rule 3
> Mentions of MCP or Mojang licensed mappings prohibited due to license concerns. Please use the names of their Yarn of Intermediary equivalents. If you do not know their equivalents, ask based on the function of the class, method, or field.

## Rule 4
> Respect and maturity is required to participate in our community. Disregarding someone's preferences, such as a name or pronouns to be referred by, is prohibited. Attempting to re-engage in a conversation against someone's will is prohibited. Organizing, promoting, inciting, or joking about the stirring up of drama, provocation, or antagonization of others, including in other communities is prohibited. Being generally annoying is prohibited.

### Social Guidelines
> The following are basic social guidelines to create a comfortable space for everyone. It is highly recommended you follow these guidelines.
- Constructive criticism is preferred over plain negativity.
- Avoid attacking other projects -- this community space is for Woven.
- Everyone is welcome, and an effort should be made to make this space as comfortable for everyone, including newcomers.
- Take care with attempts at sarcasm or jokes -- make it unquestionably clear you are trying for humor -- no matter how ridiculous your statement. Not everyone shares the same linguistic or cultural background as you, and they may take things more literally than you do. As ever, Poe's Law lives on.
- Keep in mind that your words or actions in other community spaces when referring to Woven can reflect poorly on Woven as a project. 

### Support/Discussion Guidelines
- Don't ask to ask - just ask! Instead of asking for someone to help, state your problem directly - this makes it more likely for people to engage in conversation and try to help you. See [this link](http://sol.gfxile.net/dontask.html) for examples.
- When asking a development question, it is wise to give others context from the get-go. If you're trying to do Y to achieve X, it is more helpful to us to ask "I want to achieve X, is Y the best way to do it - and if so, how should I do it?" rather than just "How do I do Y?"
